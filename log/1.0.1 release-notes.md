# bgpd v1.0.1(captain's log)
__NOTE:__ Traditional databases may not be the way to go because of performance
reasons. I've opted to use the daemons current binary database as a means of
indexing BGP updates. These entries can be queried via a URL served by the ruby
library Sinatra.

## Revision 1.0.1 Notes
__`<aaron.hebert@rackspace.com>`__<br>

* Edited compiling/PREPROCESSORS, by adding unit tests and compiling with mySQL.
* Changed the naming of some BGP methods to match the identifier naming standard.
* BGP now inherits the bgp_mysql class and bgp_mysql now defines a virtual dtor.
* Created `bgp_mysql::insert_update` to insert or update just as if mySQL were
  the ADJ-RIB-IN. The query assumes that the database scheme is already setup in
  a manual way.
* Created unit testing for bgp_mysql
* Created version definitions in `version.h`.
* Modified test packet creation for unit testing.
* Created TCP listener for Sinatra API
* Reaching the current API: 
	+ Current: 
		+ http://noc.ord.rackspace.net:4567/bgp/ipv4/10.12.0.0
	+ History: 
		+ http://noc.ord.rackspace.net:4567/bgp/ipv4/10.12.0.0/history
	+ Refined functionality comming soon.
* Each region __with the exception of LON, SYD, HKG__ now has it's own bgpd instance located on noc.REGION.rackspace.net.

__TODO:__

* Collapse TCP server loops for CLI and API into a single method.
This will reduce code bloat.
* Add more functionality to the API from this point forward.
* Start planning and patching JSON return formatting for sinatra queries.
