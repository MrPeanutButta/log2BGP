and debugging.

The follow can be specified by using the -D compiler flag.

BGP_GDB_DEBUG_NO_DAEMON         : If defined, runs bgpd in the foreground.
                                    Useful if step debugging.

BGP_GDB_DEBUG_TEST_PACKET       : Include specially crafted packets for testing.

BGP_GDB_DEBUG_RIB_PROFILE       : Profile RIB updates in seconds

TCP_CLIENT_BGPD                 : Creates pure virtual dtor for tcp_client. Needed
                                    for bgpd since BGP inherits tcp_client.
                                    virtual ~tcp_client() = 0;

WITHDRAW_LOGGING                : Turns on explicit withdraw logging.

BGP_UNIT_TEST                   : Generic unit testing.

USE_ESTABLISHED_TO_PUSH_QUEUE   : Defined to use BGP::peer_established(BGP *bgp, bgp_peer *peer)
