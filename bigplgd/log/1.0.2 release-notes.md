# bgpd v1.0.2(captain's log)
New capabilities in this revision, and 1 bug fix.

__NOTE:__ I've opted to use the daemons current binary database as a means of
indexing BGP updates. These entries can be queried via a URL served by the ruby
library Sinatra, or directly served via TCP socket API call.

BGP databases are organized by index. Each prefix may occupy up to 1000 entries. Once the max entry limit is reached (1000 entries), the oldest entries will begin to be overwritten. It's recommended that you export to some log collector if you wish to keep the data.

### Additions
* Created version definitions in `version.h`.
* Created TCP listener for Sinatra/socket API
* Reaching the sinatra API:
	+ Current:
		+ http://[serverip]:4567/bgp/ipv4/:prefix
	+ History:
		+ http://[serverip]:4567/bgp/ipv4/:prefix/history
* Reaching the TCP socket level API:
	+ open TCP socket to [serverip] port 667
    	+ write command length followed by api-get
    	+ can be tested with `telnet localhost 667`

    // Raw API sockets
    // pseudo code

    server = 10.1.1.1;
    port = 667;

    api_cmd = "api-get prefix 8.8.8.8";
    length = string_length(api_cmd);

    tcp_stream = open_socket(server, port);

    write(tcp_stream, length);
    write(tcp_stream, api_cmd);

    str_return = read(tcp_stream);


* Collapsed TCP server loops for CLI and API into a single method.
This will reduce code bloat.
* Converts all API call returns to JSON formatted strings.
* Supports wide(2byte) and narrow(1byte) character TCP sockets. e.g Unicode support

### Bug fixes
* bgpd failed to create it's withdraw database if the file didn't already exist. Failure to open it's database resulted in BGP event data not being collected.

## Bug Reporting
Please direct all requests and bug reports to __`<aaron.hebert@rackspace.com>`__<br>

## TODO (in progress)

* Add more functionality to the API from this point forward.
* Doxygen code comment clean up.
* Hosting Doxygen on projects webpage.
* Make max database entries configurable instead of hard-coded limit 1000.
* Finish [cx-lang](https://github.com/ahebert/Cx) project enough to use in configuring bgpd.

## Road-map (up coming plans)
* IPv6 and multi-protocol extensions.
* BGP Additional Paths support. [Cisco Documentation](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/xe-3s/asr1000/irg-additional-paths.html)
* The CLI application responsible for configuring `bgpd` __will be deprecated at some point in the future__. CLI will be replaced with a configuration language that will allow start-up and run-time configurations via configuration scripts. Yep, CLI is going away.
* Web front end for pulling JSON from the API and displaying in a friendly UI.
* Considering graphing BGP event data for the web front end.
